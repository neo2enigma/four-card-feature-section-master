## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [CSS Grid](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) - CSS Grid

### What I learned

Flowing into 2 different direction, along deep understanting how to layout elements in a grid is a new challenge. One vital thing is, before coding for grid:
1- Imaging the normal flow of elements, assuming they suppose to flow in one direction.
2- Draw your design in a piece of paper, try to find how each element spans over other grid cells! 


### Useful resources
